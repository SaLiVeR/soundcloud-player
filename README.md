Instructions
------------
Search for a genre in the search field and click on a result to add it to the queue. 
Alternitavely add a song directly by copy-pasting its url into the add form.

Play a sound by clicking on the play-icon (or item title) in the playlist. 
Remove a sound by clicking on the x-icon. 
Rearrange sounds by dragging and dropping them in the preferred order.

Tested on Chrome (desktop, tablet), Firefox(desktop).

To Do
-----
There some things that aren't working as I want yet.
* Ordering on refresh is not always maintained (I'm doing something wrong with the cookie)
* Does not automatically play next song in queue (I realised to late I shouldn't be using oEmbed but the widget API)
* Bookmarklet only shows the intent as I'm stuck on how to load things into an https page.
